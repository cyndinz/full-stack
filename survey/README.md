DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
This survery page shows how to control the positioning of elements on a web page. When combined with an understanding of the box model, positioning can create visually appealing web pages. 

<ul>
<li>The <strong>position</strong> property allows you to specify the position of an element.</li>
<li>When set to <strong>relative</strong>, an element’s position is relative to its default position on the page.</li>
<li>When set to <strong>absolute</strong>, an element’s position is relative to its closest positioned parent element. It can be pinned to any part of the web page, but the element will still move with the rest of the document when the page is scrolled.</li>
<li>When set to <strong>fixed</strong>, an element’s position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.</li>
<li>When set to <strong>sticky</strong>, an element can stick to a defined offset position when the user scrolls its parent container.</li>
<li>The <strong>z-index</strong> of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page when it overlaps other elements.</li>
<li>The <strong>display</strong> property allows you to control how an element flows vertically and horizontally in a document.</li>
<li><strong>inline</strong> elements take up as little space as possible, and they cannot have manually adjusted width or height.</li>
<li><strong>block</strong> elements take up the width of their container and can have manually adjusted heights.</li>
<li><strong>inline-block</strong> elements can have set width and height, but they can also appear next to each other and do not take up their entire container width.</li>
<li>The <strong>float</strong> property can move elements as far left or as far right as possible on a web page.</li>
<li>You can clear an element’s left or right side (or both) using the <strong>clear</strong> property.</li>
</ul>
