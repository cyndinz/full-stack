Other fonts<br>
The fonts you can use for your website are limitless—web fonts allow you to express your unique style through a multitude of different fonts found on the web.<br>

Free font services, like Google Fonts(https://fonts.google.com/) and Adobe Fonts(https://fonts.adobe.com/), host fonts that you can link to from your HTML document with a provided <link> element.<br>

You can also use fonts from paid font distributors like https://www.fonts.com/ by downloading and hosting them with the rest of your site’s files. You can create a @font-face ruleset in your CSS stylesheet to link to the relative path of the font file.<br>
